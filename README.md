I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer @ Rocket Mortgage.  Primarily I find myself developing in OpenEdge, though I dabble in other languages.  I enjoy integrating OpenEdge build pipelines with CircleCI and SonarQube in order to ensure quality code via branch protection rules for PRs (AKA quality gates).
